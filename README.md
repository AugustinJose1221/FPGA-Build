<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The designed architecture generates a video having a wider feild of view by stitching two video input based on features and keypoints. In simple terms, the output generated will be a panorama but with video. The architecture is optimized such that the output can be produced in real-time. The figure below illustrates the block diagram of the system depicting each step of the algorithm.
 
![Block Diagram](https://github.com/AugustinJose1221/FPGA-Build/blob/beta/img/System%20Design.jpg)

The system can be broadly divided into three subystems:
* Preprocessing
* SIFT Based Feature Extraction
* Frame Stitching

#### Preprocessing

The  input  video  stream  for  the  system  is  in  8  bit  RGB format.  Each  individual  frame  of  the  video  stream  will  have three  channels  corresponding  to  red,  green  and  blue.  The colour  information  in  the  video  frames  does  not  enhance feature  detection.  Moreover,  computation  on  a  3  channel  8 bit image takes more time compared to a single channel 8 bit image. Therefore, the RGB video frame is converted to an 8 bit grayscale image. The generated grayscale images will have lesser noise, more details in the shadows and provides better computational efficiency. 

#### SIFT Based Feature Extraction

Feature extraction from the grayscale images is done using SIFT  algorithm.  SIFT  algorithm  can  be  separated  into  two main steps:
* Keypoint Detection
* Descriptor Generation
