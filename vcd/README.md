This folder contains all the waveforms of the RTL simulation of the design files

To display a waveform,
  -> Change the working directory to FPGA-Build/vcd
  -> Run gtkwave vcd_filename.vcd
  -> Expand the module elements in the left sidebar to view each register, wire and i/o ports of that module
  -> Double click on a signal to display it on the graph
